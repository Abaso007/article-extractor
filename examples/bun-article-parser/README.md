# bun-article-parser

To install dependencies, please use `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` instead of `bun`

```bash
pnpm i
```

*`bun install` doesn't work as expected. Maybe a bug. It's new so let's give it time to fix.*


To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Open `http://localhost:3100/?url=https://www.freethink.com/technology/virtual-world` to see the result.
